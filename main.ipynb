    "- **Memoization**: Introduced a memoization dictionary (```store```) to store previously computed results for combinations of ```S``` and ```marks```. This prevents redundant calculations by checking if a specific combination has been encountered before. If so, it retrieves the result from memo instead of recomputing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Avoidance of Recomputation**: By storing and retrieving results from the ```store``` dictionary, the function bypasses the need to recompute solutions for the same combination of ```S``` and ```marks```. This significantly reduces the number of recursive calls and computations required, leading to a more efficient algorithm overall.\n",

    "This optimization effectively reduces the time complexity of the algorithm from $O(n^3)$ to $O(n^2)$ by avoiding redundant computations through memoization."
