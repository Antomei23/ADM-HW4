# Recommendation systems and clustering everywhere
Group #17 HW4\
The aim of this work is to implement a recommendation system given a dataset which contains informations about interactions on the Netflix platform.
## Scripts description
* `main.ipynb`: The notebook contains the whole project points:
  * **1. Recommendation sytem**
    * 1.1 At the beginning we want to reorganize the dataset, changing some variable in a way that we can work with, and also we want to group all visits to the same movie and add a feature 'clicks' that counts these visits.
    * 1.2 We want to create the basement for the LSH algorithm, to do it we need to create some buckets where we can find the users that are most similar, and to do this we will use a signature matrix and some Hash function that will divide the users in this buckets.
    * 1.3 LSH algorithm that will suggest the film to an user using the 2 most similar to him.
  * **2. Grouping Users together!**
    * 2.1 This section includes the preprocessing of the dataset and the creation of a new dataset (feature engineering) which stores informations about users, instead of interactions.
    * 2.2 Normalization of numerical features and dimensionality reduction are performed on the newly created dataset, to prepare it for clustering.
    * 2.3 KMeans and KMeans++ algorithms are coded from scratch and tested against their implementation in *scikit-learn*. There is also a section that concerns the searching for an optimal number of clusters.
    * 2.4 The results obtained from the KMeans++ algorithm applied on the reduced dataset are analyzed.
  * **3. Bonus Question**
    * 3.1 A density-based clustering algorithm (suggested by ChatGPT) is applied to the reduced dataset and the given output is analyzed.
  * **4. Command Line Question**: the content of the script file for an easy and more practical view of the code, and a little comment.
  * **5. Algorithmic Question**: contains the first, yet inefficient, algorithm to find in which order Federico should take the exams in order to achieve the maximum score; the optimized version of the algorithm that computes the maximum score possible and the ChatGPT optimized version. 

* `Commandline.sh`: the executable script file for the question 4
* `commandline.png`: the screen of the results of the question 4
